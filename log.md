(Did not fork the repo until R1D11. Will try to come back later and pull in my data from my tweets)


### R1D11: January 16, 2018 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about GitHub! Did the HelloWorld project (first repository, first pull request) and forked the #100DaysOfCode repository for my log. Yay!.
